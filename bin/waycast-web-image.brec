`waycast-web-image` - Make a Web image

        waycast-web-image <boundary path>

    - The `waycast-web-image` command makes a Web image delimited by the given boundary path,
      which is the path of a single file or directory.
        - It ensures that each Breccian source file stored at or under the boundary path
          is accompanied by its image, a sibling namesake with a `.xht` extension.
        - It ensures that any waycast stored at or under the boundary path is properly imaged.
        - It reforms any image file that does not postdate both its source
          and all Breccian referents of its source.
    - The working directory must be the command directory.
